## Assignment 20
Create/define a structure (`struct`) outside of `main()` that includes an `int`, `char`, and `float` member. Inside of `main()`, declare values for those `struct` members and then print their values to the terminal.

## Example Output
```terminal_session
tokyo:~/LearningC/ # ./assignment20                                         
This is the int: 50, this is the char: W, this is the float: 3.14
```
