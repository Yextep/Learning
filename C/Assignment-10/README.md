## Assignment 10
Create an integer array with 10 integers and then print the number of elements in the array to the terminal.

Hint: Play with the `sizeof()` function to determine how many bytes of storage an integer takes up.

## Example Output
```terminal_session
tokyo:~/LearningC/ # ./assignment10
